# User Stories

## Core Functionality
- As a user, I want to brainstorm ideas with AI assistance to explore creative concepts more effectively
- As a user, I want to use an infinite canvas interface to organize and navigate complex information structures with spatial flexibility
- As a new user, I want to start with text-only nodes to focus on content creation before exploring advanced formatting options

## Control & Customization
- As a user, I want a mind-mapping system that combines manual organization with AI generation, while maintaining complete control over content
- As a user, I want to create and edit nodes manually while having AI generate related nodes on demand, maintaining full control over the content structure
- As a power user, I want to specify generation parameters (e.g., "Create 3 sub-nodes about Topic1 focusing on X factor") to guide AI output

## User Experience
- As a user, I need a simple interface with minimal learning curve to quickly start organizing and expanding my ideas
- As a user, I want to edit node content directly with rich text formatting capabilities for clear information hierarchy

## Example Workflow
1. Create root node: "Renewable Energy"
2. Create his child node: "Generate 3 sub-topics focusing on storage solutions"
3. Press tu button to generate:
we generate a new node with:
   - Battery Technology Advances
   - Hydrogen Fuel Cells
   - Pumped Hydro Storage
4. Edit nodes directly to add specific research data

## Similar Products/Inspiration
- Obsidian Canvas
- Google Jamboard
- Figma Whiteboard
- Miro Infinite Canvas
- MindMeister

## Key Differentiators
- Focus on AI-assisted expansion rather than manual creation
- Text-first approach with progressive complexity
- Balance between free-form canvas and structured hierarchy
