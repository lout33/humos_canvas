# Refactoring Bug Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing `wrapText` Function Error âœ…
**Error:** `TypeError: this.wrapText is not a function` at line 644

**Cause:** During refactoring, the `wrapText` function was moved to `canvasRenderer.js` but the `InfiniteCanvas` class was still trying to call it as a method.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `wrapText` to the imports from `canvasRenderer.js`
- Updated the call in `finishEditingNode()` from `this.wrapText(...)` to `wrapText(this.ctx, ...)`

### 2. Removed Unused OpenAI Client Reference âœ…
**Issue:** Code was still trying to create `this.openaiClient` which is no longer needed since AI functionality was moved to `aiService.js`

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed the `this.openaiClient = new OpenAI(...)` line from `saveApiConfig()`
- AI client creation is now handled within the `aiService.js` module

### 3. Double Node Creation Issue (To Investigate)
**User Report:** "when i create a new node, i am creating 2 nodes one work well but the other created stay on the screen and not get removed, when i double click i just want to create one node"

**Potential Causes:**
1. Event listener duplication
2. Double-click event not properly preventing default behavior
3. State management issues during node creation
4. Canvas rendering artifacts

**Investigation Needed:**
- Check `onDoubleClick` method implementation
- Verify event listener setup in `setupEventListeners()`
- Examine node creation and drawing logic
- Test double-click behavior

## Current Status
âœ… JavaScript errors fixed
âœ… Application loads without console errors
ðŸ”„ Double node creation issue needs investigation

## Next Steps
1. Test double-click node creation behavior
2. Check for event listener duplicates
3. Debug node creation flow
4. Verify canvas drawing state management
